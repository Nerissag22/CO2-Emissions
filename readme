### Messaging
The message communicated with this narrative visualization is the impact of life expectancy on various countries over time, emphasizing how factors like adult mortality, infant deaths, and other health indicators correlate with life expectancy. The visualization aims to provide an understanding of global health disparities and trends.

### Narrative Structure
The narrative visualization follows an interactive slideshow structure. This structure is evident in the sequential scenes where the user can navigate through different steps of the story using buttons. The user can also interact with dropdowns to select specific countries and years, which updates the visualization dynamically. This step-by-step exploration allows for user interaction at each step, making it an interactive slideshow rather than a martini glass or drill-down story.

### Visual Structure
Each scene uses a different visual structure to represent the data:
- **Scene 1**: A world map color-coded by life expectancy, allowing users to see global patterns and disparities.
- **Scene 2**: A scatter plot showing life expectancy over time for a selected country, highlighting trends and changes.
- **Scene 3**: A bar chart comparing adult mortality and infant deaths for a selected country in a selected year, emphasizing specific health challenges.

These visual structures ensure the viewer can understand the data by using familiar chart types and intuitive color scales. Tooltips and annotations guide the viewer's focus to important parts of the data, while dropdowns and buttons facilitate easy navigation between scenes, helping the viewer connect the data across different scenes.

### Scenes
The scenes are:
1. **Scene 1**: World map visualization.
2. **Scene 2**: Life expectancy trend scatter plot.
3. **Scene 3**: Comparison bar chart of health indicators.

The scenes are ordered to move from a broad global patterns overview to more specific details like country-specific trends and health indicators. This order helps build context and allows the user to delve deeper into specific aspects of the data.

### Annotations
Annotations follow a template of concise text labels positioned near relevant data points. This template ensures consistency and clarity across scenes. Annotations are used to highlight significant trends or data points, supporting the messaging by drawing attention to critical information. Within a single scene, annotations remain static, providing clear and focused information without overwhelming the viewer.

### Parameters
The parameters of the narrative visualization are:
- **country**: The selected country.
- **year**: The selected year.

These parameters define the state of the visualization by filtering the data to match the user's selections. In each scene, these parameters are used to display relevant data, ensuring the visualization reflects the current state based on user inputs.

### Triggers
The triggers are:
- **Dropdown selections**: Changing the country or year dropdown updates the parameters and triggers a re-render of the current scene with the new data.
- **Navigation buttons**: Clicking the "Next" or "Previous" buttons changes the scene, updating the visualization state and displaying the relevant scene.

These triggers provide clear hints to the user, indicating that they can select different countries and years or navigate between scenes. The dropdowns and buttons are prominently displayed, making the available options evident and accessible to the user.
